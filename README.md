# AStar-PathFinding
Path finding between two cells on a randomly blocked square grid using A Star algorithm. Uses three metrics : Manhattan, Euclidean and Chebyshev. This was done as a second year course work, for the module 'Algorithms : Theory Design and Implementation'.

Add 'stdlib.jar' to the Libraries before running the project.
This project was created using Netbeans 8.1 on Windows 10.
